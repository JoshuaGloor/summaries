# Summary of "A First Course in Quantitative Finance"[[1]](#1)
## WIP!
I'm currently reading this book. The summary will likely be updated on a monthly-ish basis.

### Reason for this Summary
Based on past experience, I found it very helpful to have a summary of all the definitions, theorems etc. used in a lecture or book. This aids in looking up the most important material quickly when solving exercises or for future reference in general.

Definitions, lemmas, and theorems are abbreviated by D., L., and T., respectively. The numbering doesn't follow the book's numbering. References that use the numbering from the book will be indicated.

### Disclaimer
No guarantee is made on the correctness of the material in this summary.

If you find any mistakes, feel free to reach out via email, \<firstName>@\<lastName>.fyi, where \<firstName> and \<lastName> must be replaced by the corresponding values that can be found on this GitHub account's profile.
